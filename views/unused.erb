<p>  <em> I am inspired by Nan Goldin and Corrine Day </em></p>
  <b> They have a tendancy to SHOCK people </b>
  <em>with the subjects they choose to address. 
    <blockquote> "there is a province in which a photography only shows you what you can see with your eyes, but there's another which proves how little you can see." - Dorethea Lange </blockquote>

<sub> Many photographers focus on different ways to address their subject </sub>

<dl>Landscape<dt>taking photos of your surroundings<dd> this may be a landmark or a place that captures the 'moment'</dl>
<dl>Documentary<dt>current situations<dd> important to capture the life around you - photographers documenting society or different happenings eg. riots, partys, life </dl>
